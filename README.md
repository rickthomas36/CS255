Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The owner of DriverPass wants to design a website for training drivers.  The owner thinks that students are not receiving proper training for driving and that is why there are so many out there that are failing. The client is the owner of Driver Pass and he wants the system built for student drivers to register for a driving course training.

What did you do particularly well?
I think I worked on the designing requirements of this system well.  The designing requirements are a very critical step to creating this software and it took a lot of precise work.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would work on the functional and non-functional requirements because it is a very critical part of the project and with projectschanging over time this part of the project is never really complete.  I would like to be able to make it a little more stableso it is not ever changing.  I would improve this by getting students and employers feedback. Feedback from the clients that are using the software can be the most helpful.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I wanted to make sure I broke down all the requirements that were being asked of us.  I wanted to make sure I got each piece of each part (the client, the student, the owner and the employees) of the requirements separate which made it easier to work with.  The client’s requirements are so important because without theproper requirements the project will not be useful to them.  Basically without the requirements we could not complete the project.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
In designing the software I would first want to get the requirements of the new functionalities of the system.  Then I would design the system and add the new features.To future analyze I would want to get feedback.  Once I had thefeedback I would want to consider the system constraints.  From there I could work on doing any fixes/changes that could help the system work.
